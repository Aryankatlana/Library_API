## Future Improvements

If I had two more days, I would make a few small improvements to this project:

- Improve error messages so that the API responses are clearer when something goes wrong.
- Add some basic validations, like checking empty fields or invalid values.
- Clean up the code structure a bit more to make it easier to read and maintain.
- Add a few more sample API tests using Postman.
